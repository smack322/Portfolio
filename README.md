# Portfolio

I recently graduated from the UNH Full Stack Coding Boot Camp on March 18th, 2019. Many of the projects I have been working on have been showcased here. This website was written in HTML, Javascript and a framework called Bulma. However, if you would like to see what else I have been working on feel free to checkout the rest of my GitHub. The major technologies that Iâ€™ve learned over the past 6 months were HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, React, jQuery, Express, MySQL, and Mongo DB. I am excited to start applying these new skills and to continue to learn and grow as a developer!
